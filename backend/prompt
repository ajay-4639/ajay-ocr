Analyze the uploaded image and transcribe all visible text, focusing especially on tables, ICD-10 codes, forms, and handwritten notes. Follow these detailed instructions to ensure accurate extraction, correction, and formatting of all content:

Table Formatting

Detect and preserve all table structures using proper markdown table format.

Maintain correct alignment of columns (left, center, right as originally shown).

Distinctly identify header rows.

Keep consistent spacing and formatting in all cells.

Format using this structure:


Column1	Column2	Column3
Data1	Data2	Data3
Accurately reflect any merged cells, cell spans, or empty cells using dash symbols.

Text Formatting

Make all handwritten text bold using markdown.

Keep all printed text in regular formatting.

Retain original line breaks and spacing.

Maintain paragraph structures and document flow as in the image.

Forms and Fields

Transcribe form elements with clear label and value layout.

Preserve checkboxes and display them as: [✓] for checked [×] for crossed [ ] for empty

Lists and Bullets

Preserve bullet points and numbered lists with their original formatting.

ICD-10 Code Handling

Recognize and extract all valid ICD-10 codes using the format: A single uppercase letter followed by 2 digits, optionally followed by a dot and 1 or 2 digits.

Example valid format: Z10.24, I17.24, M54.50, K21.9

If a code starts with the digit 2, replace it with the letter Z.

If a code starts with the digit 1, replace it with the letter I.

Always retain the decimal point and digits as shown.

Apply these correction rules: 210.24 becomes Z10.24
217.24 becomes Z17.24
110.24 becomes I10.24
117.24 becomes I17.24
154.50 becomes I54.50

Code Validation and Filtering

Exclude any diagnosis or ICD-10 codes that:

Are missing the initial letter (e.g. 10.24)

Have more than two digits after the decimal (e.g. Z10.245)

Have malformed patterns (e.g. Z.10.24)

Data Type Preservation

Do NOT apply the above letter substitutions to phone numbers, fax numbers, zip codes, ID numbers, NPI numbers, or any numerically formatted data.

Treat these values as pure numbers and do not alter them.

Spelling and Geographic Correction

Intelligently correct any spelling mistakes, especially for names, city names, street names, state abbreviations, and common medical terms.

Use contextual understanding to replace misspelled place names with the closest valid real-world equivalent.

For any city or place mentioned, include the ZIP code corresponding to that city (but do not convert the ZIP code into a city name).

Ensure factual geographic consistency: for example, if a state or city is incorrectly paired, correct it to the most likely valid combination.

Use best judgment and contextual intelligence to infer and correct any ambiguities in the text related to names, places, and factual content.

Output Requirements

Output the final result in plain text only, no special characters or formatting outside of markdown standards.

Clearly separate different sections like text blocks, tables, and codes.

Maintain document structure and readability.

Special Judgment Handling

Use intelligent pattern recognition to improve text accuracy.

Match partial or incorrectly written terms to the most realistic, valid equivalent using general knowledge (e.g. ‘New Yrok’ becomes ‘New York’, ‘San Joes’ becomes ‘San Jose’).

Respect the intended meaning even if handwritten or printed characters are ambiguous.
